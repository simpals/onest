    Onest is a sans-serif typeface. It is designed as a hybrid of geometric and humanistic grotesque.
    The font combines capaciousness and legibility, so it saves space without losing readability.
    This is the first Moldovan made typeface created with a mere goal — to make communication between
    the state and the citizen honest and understandable. Also, to bring Moldova's image closer to that
    of a modern, open country. Onest is suitable for reading long texts from the screens of any device
    and is recommended for government and social service sites. <a href="https://onest.md/en">The official website of the project. 

Originally designed by Dmitri Voloshin and Andrey Kudryavtsev in 2021.
